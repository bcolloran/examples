          <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
          <p>
            I’m a data scientist and engineering
            generalist, and creator of the data science and viz platform
            <a
              href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/iodide-an-experimental-tool-for-scientific-communicatiodide-for-scientific-communication-exploration-on-the-web/"
              >Iodide</a
            >. I have a wide range of technical and quantitative skills, but in
            addition to executing on technical challenges, I have a track record
            of zooming out to clarify how quantitative understanding can solve
            real business problems; of identifying opportunities and
            implementing solutions that go beyond code and numbers when those
            tools aren’t enough; and leading teams to solve big problems.

            This page shows a few pieces of work that demonstrate my approach
            to visual data storytelling, where I focus above all on <i>clarity</i>,
            leveraging my deep background
            in data science to illuminate particularly complicated concepts
            using a combination of prose and rich visuals.

            work. Note that while on this page I describe my work and it's
            impact in it's original context, a number of the visualizations
            linked below have been recreated with synthetic data and
            hypothetical product names and analysis details to prevent any
            confusion about the sharing of real product data.

              This is a re-creation of a dashboard that was built to give
              decision makers insight into long-term trends and annual
              variability in Firefox usage. Additionally, it provided forecasts
              with uncertainty estimates to guide goal-setting and to allow
              decision makers to track progress against projections.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="impact">IMPACT:</span> Before this dashboard was
              deployed, leadership did not have a clear understanding of
              Firefox's usage trajectory or seasonal patterns of product usage.
              This would cause great consternation every June when usage numbers
              dropped, and excessive optimism when they recovered in October.
              Presenting a comprehensive overview of how these daily numbers
              break down into long-term trends and shorter-term cycles allowed
              more stable and robust long-term planning and day-to-day decision
              making. The value of this visualization was proved by its
              longevity: while most dashboards are deprecated after only 12-18
              months, this one remained in active used for <em>seven years</em>.

              In 2016, Mozilla launched an organization-wide push to identify
              our most active users and to focus product development efforts on
              attracting and retaining those users. There was a long-standing
              belief in the product organization that "heavy users" would also
              be "power users" (i.e. technology enthusiasts with powerful
              computers), and that we could target our efforts by reaching out
              to these people. This visualization addressed the relationship
              between measures of product usage and computer hardware quality.

              by allowing product managers to explore these relationships and

              that developing user personas based around the idea of tech
              enthusiasts would not achieve the desired results. Because of
              this, product management engaged with the data science to develop
              a well-founded set of proxy metrics for "heavy users".

              In order to protect user privacy, Firefox's first major data
              collection effort relied on a complicated set of ID exchanges.
              Once deployed, it turned out that this ID handling was very error
              prone, and individual browser instances were submitting enormous
              amounts of duplicate data. This caused a critical data set to be
              essentially unusable for many data science purposes. The data
              science team presented textual reports on the issue, but many
              engineers involved in building the data collection system believed
              these analyses were incorrect and that the problem could not be as
              severe as described.

              This convinced the engineering team that the problem was real and
              demanded attention, leading to a major overhaul of this essential
              data collection system which unblocked data science across the
              company.

              Depicting the relationship between categorical variables can be
              tricky, and even more so if your story needs to show the level of
              confidence you can have in those relationships. This visualization
              of the survey responses allow viewers to quickly see the "marginal
              distributions" of each individual variable, as well the
              relationships between the variables and the statistical confidence
              level in the strength of those relationships.

              were often viewed skeptically. By focusing on rigor and presenting
              results in a manner that visually underscored the sophistication
              of the analysis, the research team was able to persuasively engage
