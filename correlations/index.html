    <h1>Do "power users" play MegaFarmTown more often?</h1>

    <p>
      We've often wondered whether so-called "power users" with more powerful
      devices play MegaFarmTown more ofter than users with less powerful
      devices, and wether we should focus our product and marketing attention on
      these users. The visualization below gives an overview of MegaFarmTown
      users across a number of attributes for which we have data, allowing us to
      answer this and many other questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      At top is a correlation matrix, which summarizes of the relationships
      between the attibutes. Below that are two scatter plots; the first shows
      the <em>measured values</em> (excluding the top and bottom .5%), and the
      second shows the <em>percentile rank</em> of each measurement ordered from
      lowest observed to highest observed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hovering over an entry in the correlation matrix will show the numerical
      value of the corellation for the variables in question; clicking that
      entry will update the scatter plots.

    <h1>Key takeaways:</h1>

    <p>
      Most measures of usage show a high degree of correlation, as expected. For
      example
      <a
        onclick="mousedownShowDetails('Seconds in game','Games played (total)')"
      >
        Seconds in game vs. Games played (total)</a
      >
      and
      <a
        onclick="mousedownShowDetails('Tournaments (total entered)','Games played (total)')"
      >
        Tournaments (total entered) vs. Games played (total)</a
      >
      are strongly related. More generally, the high degree of correlation
      between all the usage variables measured here -- represented by the region
      of high correlation in the bottom right -- should give us confidence that
      for most practical purposes, there is essentially one underlying dimension
      of "game activity".
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we only very weak correlations between activity and hardware
      quality:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          onclick="mousedownShowDetails('Seconds in game','Device number of cores')"
          >Seconds in game vs Number of cores</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a onclick="mousedownShowDetails('Seconds in game','Device memory')"
          >Seconds in game vs RAM</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a onclick="mousedownShowDetails('Seconds in game','Device CPU speed')"
          >Seconds in game vs cpu speed</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While there is a very weak relationship here, the evidence does not
      support the idea that "power users" or "tech enthusiasts" with powerful
      devices play more frequently.
