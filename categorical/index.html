          <h4>A NOVEL PICTURE OF CATEGORICAL DATA</h4>
          <p>
            Depicting the relationship between categorical variables can be
            tricky, and even more so if your story needs to show the level of
            confidence you can have in those relationships. This novel
            visualization of categorical crosstabs allow viewers to quickly see
            relationships between the variables, the statistical confidence
            level in the strength of those relationships, and the marginal
            distributions of each individual variable, providing an at-a-glance
            overview without omitting important details.

            Correlation heat maps can effectively provide an overview of the
            relationships between a categorical variables with a large number of
            levels, but they are not ideal for handling a variables with only a
            few levels for two main reasons. First, while color variation may be
            able to convey coarse relationships, the human eye has a very
            limited capacity to understand the <em>scale</em> of differences
            encoded with color alone. Second, a simple heat map cannot easily
            depict uncertainty, which requires adding a third dimension to what
            is effectively a two dimensional image.
          </p>
          <p>
            The graph at the right overcomes these problems by presenting
            correlation information as a series of glyphs on a grid. At each
            point on the grid, the white box outline indicates the number of
            observations we'd expect to see by chance, and the solid colored bar
            indicates the number we actually observe. The hue of the bar
            indicates whether our observation is lower (blue) or higher (red)
            than expected, and the saturation of the color indicates the
            statistical significance of the difference from expectation. Rather
            than presenting correlations with color alone, this visualization
            encodes key information in <em>lengths</em>, which allows the human
            visual system to much more easily make comparisons and judgments
            about scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, by rotating the grid 45 degrees, we can easily show the
            <em>marginal distributions</em> of the observations in the gray bars
            along the grid's edges, while still keeping the important semantic
            length information running along the vertical axis to facilitate
            comparisons between all of the items represented.
